attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly

down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving

Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its

All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they

Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;

God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has

ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no
gods.
Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

And lately, did I hear him say these words: "God is dead: of his pity
for man has God died."-
So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.
All creators, however, are hard.-

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

, source=Jung_Short, label=null), concept=Meaning, score=85.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

, source=Jung_Short, label=Jung_Short1), concept=Wisdom, score=75.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;

God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be

God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-

It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could

"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.

does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!

toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in

transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!

Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm

shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no
gods.
Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.

my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-

Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!

my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

gods.
Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-

emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-

Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm

reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no
gods.
Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

my visions! Ah, that it should slumber in the hardest, ugliest stone!
Now rages my hammer ruthlessly against its prison. From the stone
fly the fragments: what's that to me?
I will complete it: for a shadow came to me- the still and lightest of all
things once came to me!
The beauty of the Superman came to me as a shadow. Ah, my broth-

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

small kindness is not forgotten, it becomes a gnawing worm.
"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

Thus spoke the devil to me, once on a time: "Even God has his hell: it
is his love for man."
And lately, did I hear him say these words: "God is dead: of his pity
for man has God died."-
So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.
All creators, however, are hard.-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

shame and devotion!
Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.
70
, source=Jung_Short, label=Jung_Short1), concept=Wisdom, score=75.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;

God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.

But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be

God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to

Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-

All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit

Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the

The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!

for man has God died."-
So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.
All creators, however, are hard.-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

, source=Jung_Short, label=Jung_Short1), concept=Religion, score=45.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;

God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.

does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

, source=Jung_Short, label=null), concept=Meaning, score=85.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

And lately, did I hear him say these words: "God is dead: of his pity

So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.
All creators, however, are hard.-

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.

In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would

False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-

aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and

They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing

Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-

Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

, source=Jung_Short, label=Jung_Short1), concept=Wisdom, score=75.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!

In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!

down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no
gods.
Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

, source=Jung_Short, label=Jung_Short1), concept=Wisdom, score=75.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;

God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-

But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-

follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.

the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-

But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-

All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in

Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those

I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-

jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a

To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even

All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-

All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to

Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-

No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it

"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.

It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

shame and devotion!
Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.
70
, source=Jung_Short, label=null), concept=Meaning, score=85.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be

God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to

Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.
70
, source=Jung_Short, label=Jung_Short1), concept=Wisdom, score=75.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;

God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.

But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be

God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-

All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it

best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could

language of all creators.
All creators, however, are hard.-

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

, source=Jung_Short, label=Jung_Short1), concept=Religion, score=45.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;

God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.

But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be

God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.

does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!

down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

, source=Jung_Short, label=null), concept=Meaning, score=85.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it

"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!

enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!

had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.

as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no
gods.
Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this

There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-

Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-

Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly

down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!

down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in

unexhausted and undiscovered.

with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;

God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-

Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a

his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:

And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no
gods.
Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

Now rages my hammer ruthlessly against its prison. From the stone
fly the fragments: what's that to me?
I will complete it: for a shadow came to me- the still and lightest of all
things once came to me!
The beauty of the Superman came to me as a shadow. Ah, my broth-

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

small kindness is not forgotten, it becomes a gnawing worm.
"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

is his love for man."
And lately, did I hear him say these words: "God is dead: of his pity
for man has God died."-
So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.
All creators, however, are hard.-

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

, source=Jung_Short, label=null), concept=Meaning, score=85.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

small kindness is not forgotten, it becomes a gnawing worm.
"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

And lately, did I hear him say these words: "God is dead: of his pity

So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.
All creators, however, are hard.-

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

, source=Jung_Short, label=Jung_Short1), concept=Wisdom, score=75.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!

down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!

down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no
gods.
Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

Now rages my hammer ruthlessly against its prison. From the stone

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

small kindness is not forgotten, it becomes a gnawing worm.
"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-

Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;

God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-

But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-

God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly

down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no
gods.
Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

And lately, did I hear him say these words: "God is dead: of his pity
for man has God died."-
So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.
All creators, however, are hard.-

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

, source=Jung_Short, label=null), concept=Meaning, score=85.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

small kindness is not forgotten, it becomes a gnawing worm.
"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

Thus spoke the devil to me, once on a time: "Even God has his hell: it
is his love for man."
And lately, did I hear him say these words: "God is dead: of his pity
for man has God died."-
So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.
All creators, however, are hard.-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

shame and devotion!
Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.
70
, source=Jung_Short, label=Jung_Short1), concept=Wisdom, score=75.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood

And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-

been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

, source=Jung_Short, label=Jung_Short1), concept=Religion, score=45.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.

does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.

selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!

prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

Never yet has there been a Superman. Naked have I seen both of them,

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-

Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly

down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;

God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has

Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all

shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still

people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.

prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.

why will you not pluck at my wreath?

You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of

gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!

isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.

The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-

Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm

Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

gods.
Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.

prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-

Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.

shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.

THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-

And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a

To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even

All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-

Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.
70
, source=Jung_Short, label=null), concept=Meaning, score=85.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;

God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-

God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to

Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-

Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-

But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-

All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account

Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit

Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.

The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants

petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this

It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

, source=Jung_Short, label=Jung_Short1), concept=Wisdom, score=75.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;

God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.

But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-

God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to

Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,

manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-

All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great

If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-

But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-

manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-

All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those

I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

shame and devotion!
Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

Now rages my hammer ruthlessly against its prison. From the stone

I will complete it: for a shadow came to me- the still and lightest of all
things once came to me!
The beauty of the Superman came to me as a shadow. Ah, my broth-

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

And lately, did I hear him say these words: "God is dead: of his pity

So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.
All creators, however, are hard.-

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

, source=Jung_Short, label=Jung_Short1), concept=Wisdom, score=75.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.

ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-

emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm

shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.

I will complete it: for a shadow came to me- the still and lightest of all
things once came to me!
The beauty of the Superman came to me as a shadow. Ah, my broth-
ers! Of what account now are- the gods to me!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

small kindness is not forgotten, it becomes a gnawing worm.
"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

Thus spoke the devil to me, once on a time: "Even God has his hell: it
is his love for man."
And lately, did I hear him say these words: "God is dead: of his pity
for man has God died."-
So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.
All creators, however, are hard.-

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

shame and devotion!
Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but

You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one

noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-

The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-

Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-

Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

gods.
Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no
gods.
Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

Now rages my hammer ruthlessly against its prison. From the stone
fly the fragments: what's that to me?
I will complete it: for a shadow came to me- the still and lightest of all
things once came to me!
The beauty of the Superman came to me as a shadow. Ah, my broth-

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

And lately, did I hear him say these words: "God is dead: of his pity
for man has God died."-
So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.
All creators, however, are hard.-

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.

high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no
gods.
Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-

worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no
gods.
Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-

Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-

God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a

Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus

For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-

But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the

me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.

shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.

THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the

Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now

verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!

jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a

All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

is his love for man."
And lately, did I hear him say these words: "God is dead: of his pity
for man has God died."-
So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.
All creators, however, are hard.-

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

shame and devotion!
Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit

young- so have patience with it!

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from

And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How

There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-

Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be

God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul

Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from

And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How

There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-

Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!

Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no
gods.
Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

my visions! Ah, that it should slumber in the hardest, ugliest stone!
Now rages my hammer ruthlessly against its prison. From the stone
fly the fragments: what's that to me?
I will complete it: for a shadow came to me- the still and lightest of all
things once came to me!
The beauty of the Superman came to me as a shadow. Ah, my broth-

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

is his love for man."
And lately, did I hear him say these words: "God is dead: of his pity
for man has God died."-
So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.
All creators, however, are hard.-

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no
gods.
Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

Now rages my hammer ruthlessly against its prison. From the stone

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

small kindness is not forgotten, it becomes a gnawing worm.
"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which

Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-

Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-

When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;

God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-

Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!

down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.

couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.

cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

small kindness is not forgotten, it becomes a gnawing worm.
"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all

Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.

hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no
gods.
Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

my visions! Ah, that it should slumber in the hardest, ugliest stone!
Now rages my hammer ruthlessly against its prison. From the stone
fly the fragments: what's that to me?
I will complete it: for a shadow came to me- the still and lightest of all
things once came to me!
The beauty of the Superman came to me as a shadow. Ah, my broth-

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

is his love for man."
And lately, did I hear him say these words: "God is dead: of his pity
for man has God died."-
So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.
All creators, however, are hard.-

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.
All creators, however, are hard.-

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no
gods.
Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

small kindness is not forgotten, it becomes a gnawing worm.
"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no
gods.
Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and

THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the

But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-

follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus

Ah, you men, within the stone slumbers an image for me, the image of
my visions! Ah, that it should slumber in the hardest, ugliest stone!
Now rages my hammer ruthlessly against its prison. From the stone
fly the fragments: what's that to me?
I will complete it: for a shadow came to me- the still and lightest of all
things once came to me!
The beauty of the Superman came to me as a shadow. Ah, my broth-
ers! Of what account now are- the gods to me!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

small kindness is not forgotten, it becomes a gnawing worm.
"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

, source=Jung_Short, label=Jung_Short1), concept=Religion, score=45.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.

shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.

THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now

verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!

jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even

All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-

But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-

All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to

Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-

No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,

And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.
70
, source=Jung_Short, label=null), concept=Meaning, score=85.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;

God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-

God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to

Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-

But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-

All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.

many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

, source=Jung_Short, label=Jung_Short1), concept=Wisdom, score=75.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;

God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be

God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those

I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"

Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.

does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!

viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

, source=Jung_Short, label=null), concept=Meaning, score=85.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it

"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!

had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no
gods.
Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be

God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!

down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-

Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;

God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-

Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.

why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no
gods.
Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

small kindness is not forgotten, it becomes a gnawing worm.
"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

is his love for man."
And lately, did I hear him say these words: "God is dead: of his pity
for man has God died."-
So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.
All creators, however, are hard.-

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

And lately, did I hear him say these words: "God is dead: of his pity

So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.
All creators, however, are hard.-

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!

down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

Now rages my hammer ruthlessly against its prison. From the stone

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit

Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to

sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there

It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

, source=Jung_Short, label=Jung_Short1), concept=Wisdom, score=75.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;

God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-

But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-

follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-

All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-

But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-

manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-

All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those

I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

shame and devotion!
Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.
70
, source=Jung_Short, label=null), concept=Meaning, score=85.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

small kindness is not forgotten, it becomes a gnawing worm.
"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

is his love for man."
And lately, did I hear him say these words: "God is dead: of his pity
for man has God died."-
So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.
All creators, however, are hard.-

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.
70
, source=Jung_Short, label=Jung_Short1), concept=Wisdom, score=75.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood

And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-

heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!

the greatest man and the small man:-
All-too-similar are they still to each other. Even the greatest found I-
all-too-human!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

, source=Jung_Short, label=null), concept=Meaning, score=85.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no
gods.
Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

small kindness is not forgotten, it becomes a gnawing worm.
"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-

Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;

God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly

down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to

When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-

It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a

This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no
gods.
Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

for man has God died."-
So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

, source=Jung_Short, label=null), concept=Meaning, score=85.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

small kindness is not forgotten, it becomes a gnawing worm.
"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.
70
, source=Jung_Short, label=Jung_Short1), concept=Wisdom, score=75.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be

God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood

And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-

Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-
God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!

Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be
your best creating!-
God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-

the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a

All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-

Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-

transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-

Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-

But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and

THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the

God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-

But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

small kindness is not forgotten, it becomes a gnawing worm.
"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.

THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the

Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now

verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!

jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a

To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even

All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-

All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to

Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-

No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.
70
, source=Jung_Short, label=null), concept=Meaning, score=85.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;
now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.
God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.
Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods!
But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be

God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-

All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.
70
, source=Jung_Short, label=Jung_Short1), concept=Wisdom, score=75.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;

God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.

But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be

God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to

Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-

All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it

best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could

language of all creators.
All creators, however, are hard.-

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

, source=Jung_Short, label=Jung_Short1), concept=Religion, score=45.0), SimilarityScore(id=null, text=PDFText(text=With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the
craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.
Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas;

God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach bey-
ond your creating will.

But you could well create the Superman.
Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and fore-
fathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be

God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable.
Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you,
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the hu-
manly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you
follow out to the end!
And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.

does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!

down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

me!
To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathus-
tra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!
My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.
Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds' flutes! Ah, that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we
already learned with one another!

In the Happy Isles
THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now
their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear
sky, and afternoon.
Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-
ance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.

reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!
And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning
ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the
irrational.

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this con-
jecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from
the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a
lie?
To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even
vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjec-
ture such a thing.
Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and
the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!
All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.
Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies
shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.
Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and
perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.

transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus
are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.
For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be will-
ing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.
Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred
cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heart-
breaking last hours.
But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more can-
didly: just such a fate- wills my Will.
All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to
me as my emancipator and comforter.
Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipa-
tion- so teaches you Zarathustra.
No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,
that that great debility may ever be far from me!
And also in discerning do I feel only my will's procreating and
evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is be-
cause there is will to procreation in it.

The Compassionate
MY FRIENDS, there has arisen a satire on your friend: "Behold Zarathus-
tra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?"
But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that

The Giving Virtue
1.
WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," many people who called
themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus
they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now
wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples,
however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent
twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and
leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:
Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is un-
common, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives
itself.
Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest
value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace
between moon and sun.
Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft
of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.
I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue.
What would you have in common with cats and wolves?
You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst
to amass all riches in your soul.
Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your vir-
tue is insatiable in desiring to give.
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.
Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this
selfishness healthy and sacred,.-
There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which
would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.

craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it
prowl round the tables of givers.
Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the lar-
cenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.
Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not
degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving
soul is lacking.
Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror
to us is the degenerate sense, which says: "All for myself."
Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of
an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.
Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the
spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its
companion and echo.
All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they
only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!
Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak
in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.
Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights
the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefact-
or of all.
When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing
and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to
command all things, as a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot
couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.
When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is neces-
sary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.
It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a
new fountain!
This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a dis-
cerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.

Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.
Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your vir-
tue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.
Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against etern-
al walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!
Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes,
back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human
meaning!
A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and
blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our
body: it has there become body and will.
A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred.
Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has
become embodied in us!
Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in
us. It is dangerous to be an heir.
Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all
mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.
Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my broth-
ers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you
shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!
With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with know-
ledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the
exalted, the soul becomes joyful.
Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.
There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a
thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man's world is still
unexhausted and undiscovered.
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds
with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.
You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a
people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen
people:- and out of them, the Superman.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had
not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in
his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:
I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.
I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathus-
tra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but
also to hate his friends.
One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And
why will you not pluck at my wreath?
You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day col-
lapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!
You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra!
You are my believers: but what matters all believers!
You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all be-
lievers; thus all belief matters so little.
Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have
all denied me will I return to you.
With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with an-
other love shall I then love you.
And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one
hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great
noontide with you.
And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the even-
ing as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.
Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the
sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
"Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live."- Let this be
our final will at the great noontide!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Child with the Mirror
AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the
solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a
sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient
and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much
to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love,
and keep modest as a giver.
Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom
meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.
One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having
meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:
Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come
to me, carrying a mirror?
"O Zarathustra"- said the child to me- "look at yourself in the mirror!"
But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for
not myself did I see therein, but a devil's grimace and derision.
All too well do I understand the dream's portent and monition: my
doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!
My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I
gave them.
Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-
With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit
inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a
coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.
What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too
young- so have patience with it!

My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and
sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul
into the valleys.
Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has
solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.
Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!
There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of
my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!
New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I become-
like all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on
worn-out soles.
Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I
leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!
Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed
isles where my friends sojourn;-
And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I
may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.
And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear al-
ways help me up best: it is my foot's ever ready servant:-
The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my en-
emies that I may at last hurl it!
Too great has been the tension of my cloud: 'twixt laughters of light-
nings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.
Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.

shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.

THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the
red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.
Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabund-

And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your
reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And
verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!

the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?
God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands
reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a

To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even

All the imperishable- that's but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-
But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise
shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!
Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's allevi-
ation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much
transformation.
Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus

But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walks amongst
men as amongst animals."
Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.
How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be
ashamed too oft?
O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shame-
that is the history of man!
And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash:
bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.
I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too desti-
tute are they of bashfulness.
If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is prefer-
ably at a distance.
Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recog-
nized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!
May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,
and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in
common!
I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I
always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.
Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little:
that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!
And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best
to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.
Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do
I wipe also my soul.
For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account
of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.

small kindness is not forgotten, it becomes a gnawing worm.
"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!"- thus do I advise those
who have naught to give.
I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends.
Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.
Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to
give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.
And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the
sting of conscience teaches one to sting.
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done
evilly than to have thought pettily!
To be sure, you say: "The delight in petty evils spares one many a great
evil deed." But here one should not wish to be sparing.
Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it
speaks honorably.
"Behold, I am disease," says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants
to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the
petty infection.
To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this
word in the ear: "Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there
is still a path to greatness!"-
Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And
many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means pen-
etrate him.
It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.
And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him
who does not concern us at all.
If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his
suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him
best.
And if a friend does you wrong, then say: "I forgive you what you
have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could
I forgive that!"
Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.
One should hold fast one's heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly
does one's head run away!

Woe to all loving ones who have not an elevation which is above their
pity!
Thus spoke the devil to me, once on a time: "Even God has his hell: it
is his love for man."
And lately, did I hear him say these words: "God is dead: of his pity
for man has God died."-
So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a
heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!
But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it
seeks- to create what is loved!
"Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself"- such is the
language of all creators.
All creators, however, are hard.-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Priests
AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these
words to them:
"Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords!
Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too
much:- so they want to make others suffer.
Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.
And readily does he soil himself who touches them.
But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood
honored in theirs."-
And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long
had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:
It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but
that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and
stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-
In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would
save them from their Saviour!
On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed
them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!
False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mor-
tals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.
But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has
built tabernacles upon it.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built them-
selves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!
Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly
aloft to its height!
But so enjoins their belief: "On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!"

shame and devotion!
Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it
not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under
the clear sky?
And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and
down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my
heart to the seats of this God.
They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,
there was much hero-spirit in their worship!
And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing
men to the cross!
As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;
even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.
And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the
toad sings his song with sweet gravity.
Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Sa-
viour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!
Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penit-
ence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!
Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom's sev-
enth heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!
Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect
had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.
In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and
o'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.
Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;
as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also
were still of the flock!
Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my broth-
ers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto
been!
Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their
folly taught that truth is proved by blood.
But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest
teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.
And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that
prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning comes one's
own teaching!

And by still greater ones than any of the saviours must you be saved,
my brothers, if you would find the way to freedom!
Never yet has there been a Superman. Naked have I seen both of them,
the greatest man and the small man:-
All-too-similar are they still to each other. Even the greatest found I-
all-too-human!-
Thus spoke Zarathustra.
